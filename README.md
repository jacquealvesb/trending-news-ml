# Trending news ML
An app to check a news category using machine learning and trending news of a category using natural language processing

## Getting Started

To run the app on XCode, you'll have to have a key for GNews API.
You can get one by creating an account at [GNews API website](https://gnews.io).

## Running the app

After getting the key, you'll need to put it on the project so your app can use the API. Open *Constants.swift* file on the *Model* folder and replace the *gnewsAPIKey* variable value with your GNews API Key .

```swift
// Constants.swift

let gnewsAPIKey = "YOUR API KEY"

```

After doing that, you'll be able to run the project normally.
